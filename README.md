## Description

Sakura Study is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) language learning app designed to help people study Japanese using a gamified approach, similar to Duolingo. The app offers exercises for users to practice material from the popular Japanese textbook, [Genki: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese (3rd edition)](https://genki3.japantimes.co.jp/en/), including hiragana, katakana, kanji, vocabulary, and phrases. It also features leaderboards for users to compete with each other and track their progress, along with a dark mode feature. It was created to assist students of all ages and levels in learning Japanese in a fun and engaging way through self-study.

‚≠ê Note: The website may require some time for the server to spin up.
